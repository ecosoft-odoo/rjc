When you receive a check, cash or transfer that pays a customer invoice,

go to the menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Payment Intransit*,
create a new payment in-transit and set the journal *Bank Intransit*
and select the bank account on which you want to receive.
Then click on *Add a line* to select the payment,
type of payment and allocation to in-transit.
Eventually, validate the deposit.
